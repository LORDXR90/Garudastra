It is a device that senses a motion and responds to it. There are several sensors that we see in everyday life such as light sensors, motion sensors, sound sensors etc. Every sensor has its own merits and demerits. Sensors are something that make our lives easier in multiple ways. In Technical Terms, a sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem that detects events or changes in its environment and sends the information to other electronics, often a computer processor. Sensors are always used with other electronics. (“Sensor - Wikipedia”) \n",
            "Sensors are used in almost every field in the present-day. These compact devices have enormous potential to be explored. Modifications of basic sensors can be of significant use in our lives. Combination of multiple sensors creates a smart sensor, which we will discuss later. The goal of any sensor is simple: gather information (vibration, temperature, pressure, voltage) that can be fed into algorithms and analytics for better real-time decision-making. Sensors play a critical role in many modern technologies, from smartphones to self-driving cars, and their applications are only continuing to grow. 1.2 History of Sensors \n",
            "Sensors have been in use for more than a century now. They have blended into our Lifes in a way that we can’t imagine what our lives would be without them. From smartwatches we wear to cars we drive, homes we live in, sensors have made an impact everywhere. Different sensors came into life at different points in our history. The first Thermostat sensor that came to the market was in 1883. Infrared sensors have been in market since late 1940’s. First motion sensor that was used as an alarm came out in 1950’s. There is not a single person who could be given credit for the invention of sensors. 1.3 Types of Sensors \n",
            "There are about 15 broad categories of sensors: \n",

They are often used to monitor and regulate fluid pressures in pipes, machine pressure, and other systems. This vital technology is used in many different sectors, including automotive, aerospace, medical, and environmental. Pressure sensors are essential to the safety and success of many processes and systems. Force Sensors - Force sensors help us determine the amount of force or weight applied to an object, which is helpful in a variety of applications. They turn the applied force or pressure into an electrical signal, which can be used to determine and measure the quantum of force. In manufacturing, robotics, and other sectors, force sensors are routinely used to watch and regulate forces applied to machines, tools, and other equipment. They may also be used to measure the force of muscles, joints, and other biological tissues in exploration and development. Force sensors are critical for ensuring precision and accuracy in various processes and preventing damage to machinery and equipment. Thermal Sensors - Thermal sensors are valuable tools for accurately measuring temperature changes around them, which can be used in a variety of settings. Climate control, industrial operations, and medical devices all benefit from the use of thermal sensors.
